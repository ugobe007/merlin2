## üí∞ Advanced Cost Calculation Features

### **1. Utility Rates Database** ‚≠ê NEW
Created comprehensive database with 16 countries:

**For Each Location:**
- Electricity Rate ($/kWh) - Average
- Peak Rate ($/kWh) - During high demand
- Off-Peak Rate ($/kWh) - During low demand  
- Demand Charge ($/kW/month) - Peak power penalty
- Diesel Price ($/gallon) - For generators
- Natural Gas Price ($/therm) - For generators
- Currency designation

**Example Rates**:
- **United States**: $0.14/kWh avg, $0.22 peak, $0.08 off-peak, $15/kW demand
- **Germany**: $0.38/kWh avg (high), $7.80/gal diesel
- **India**: $0.07/kWh avg (low), $3.90/gal diesel

### **2. Generator Fuel Consumption Calculations** ‚≠ê NEW
**Diesel Generators**:
- ~0.06 gallons per kWh at full load
- Annual cost = MW √ó 1000 √ó 0.06 √ó runtime hours √ó local diesel price

**Natural Gas Generators**:
- ~0.008 therms per kWh at full load
- Annual cost = MW √ó 1000 √ó 0.008 √ó runtime hours √ó local gas price

**Default Runtime**: 500 hours/year (backup usage pattern)

### **3. Energy Savings Calculations** ‚≠ê NEW
**Peak Shaving Strategy**:
- Assumes 70% of battery cycles during peak hours
- Calculates savings from peak/off-peak arbitrage
- Includes demand charge reduction (monthly √ó 12)

**Formula**:
```
Annual Savings = (Peak shaving kWh √ó Peak rate differential) + (Demand kW √ó Monthly charge √ó 12)
```

### **4. ROI Timeline Generator** ‚≠ê NEW
**Calculates 20-year projection**:
- Year-by-year cumulative savings
- Net position (savings - initial cost)
- ROI percentage
- Identifies payback year (when net position >= 0)

**Output Format**:
```
Year 1: $500k saved, -$2M net, 25% ROI
Year 5: $2.5M saved, +$500k net, 125% ROI
Year 10: $5M saved, +$3M net, 250% ROI
```

### **5. Solar Space Requirements** ‚≠ê NEW
**Constants Defined**:
- 150 sq ft per kW (average)
- 14 square meters per kW
- 400W per panel
- 20 sq ft per panel

**Usage**: Can calculate if available roof/land space supports solar configuration
