## 2. Engagement Strategy

### Phase 1: Relationship Building (Month 1-2)

**Actions:**
1. ☐ Attend NREL webinars on storage economics
2. ☐ Submit questions through ATB feedback form
3. ☐ Connect with Paul Denholm on LinkedIn
4. ☐ Request StoreFAST documentation clarifications via email
5. ☐ Register for ESA Annual Conference

**Templates:**

**Initial Email to NREL:**
```
Subject: StoreFAST Methodology Alignment Question - Commercial BESS Platform

Dear Dr. Denholm,

I'm writing on behalf of Merlin Energy Technologies, a commercial BESS quoting 
platform. We've built our financial analysis methodology to align with NREL's 
StoreFAST model and ATB cost data.

We'd appreciate clarification on:
1. Whether our LCOS formula implementation correctly follows StoreFAST methodology
2. How commercial-scale (C&I) projects should be differentiated from utility-scale 
   in ATB cost assumptions
3. Whether there's a pathway for methodology review or validation

We've prepared a methodology document [attached] showing our alignment with 
NREL publications.

Best regards,
[Name]
```

### Phase 2: Formal Inquiry (Month 2-3)

**Actions:**
1. ☐ Submit NREL Industry Partnership inquiry
2. ☐ Contact Sandia ESS Program for review options
3. ☐ Prepare presentation for methodology walkthrough
4. ☐ Document specific validation requests

**Validation Request Scope:**
```
We request review of:
1. LCOS calculation methodology (alignment with StoreFAST)
2. NPV/IRR calculation approach
3. Battery degradation modeling
4. Cost benchmark application methodology
5. Value stack calculation approach
```

### Phase 3: Formal Engagement (Month 3-6)

**Options by Budget:**

| Budget | Path | Expected Outcome |
|--------|------|------------------|
| $0 | Conference networking + email | Informal feedback |
| $10K | TAP consultation | Specific questions answered |
| $50K | NREL partnership (limited) | Written methodology review |
| $100K+ | Full NREL partnership | Published validation |

---

## 3. DOE Program Manager Path

**Alternative approach via DOE funding programs:**

### DOE Office of Electricity (OE)
- Funds Sandia ESS program
- Program Manager: Dr. Imre Gyuk (retired 2023, successor TBD)
- Interest: Standards development, cost reduction

### DOE EERE Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO)
- Funds NREL solar+storage research
- Interest: Cost benchmarking, deployment acceleration

**Engagement:**
- Apply for SBIR/STTR funding for methodology validation
- Topic areas: "Energy Storage Cost Modeling" or "Financial Analysis Tools"
