# Smart Wizard Redesign - Customer-Focused Workflow

## Problem Statement
- Users don't understand "BESS" or "Hybrid BESS" terminology
- Current workflow is too technical upfront
- Need quick access to configurations (menu-style)
- Missing clear options for installation, logistics, and financing

## New Terminology
- **BESS** → **Energy Storage**
- **Hybrid BESS** → **Energy Storage + Renewables** or **Hybrid Energy System**
- **Battery System** → **Energy Storage System**
- **MWh** → Show in both MW/MWh AND hours (e.g., "2 MW / 4 hours of storage")

## Redesigned Workflow (3 Main Phases)

### PHASE 1: BUILD YOUR ENERGY CONFIGURATION 💰
**Goal:** Help customers understand what they need and how much they'll save

#### Step 1: What's Your Goal? (Start Simple)
Select your primary objective:
- ✅ **Reduce Energy Bills** (Peak shaving, demand charges)
- ✅ **Backup Power** (Keep operations running during outages)
- ✅ **Use More Solar/Wind** (Store renewable energy)
- ✅ **Earn Money from the Grid** (Sell services to utility)
- ✅ **Go Green** (Sustainability goals)
- ✅ **All of the Above** (Maximize value)

*Each option shows a quick tooltip with simple explanation*

#### Step 2: Quick Configuration Menu
**Two paths:**

**PATH A: Start from Industry Template** (Recommended)
- Manufacturing Facility
- Office Building  
- Data Center
- Warehouse/Distribution
- Hotel/Hospitality
- Retail Store
- Farm/Agriculture
- Custom Configuration

*Each template pre-fills typical values*

**PATH B: Custom Build**
Simple inputs:
- **Energy Storage Size**: Slider with visual indicators
  - Small (1-2 MW): "Powers 200 homes"
  - Medium (3-5 MW): "Powers 500 homes" 
  - Large (5+ MW): "Powers 1000+ homes"
  - Custom: Enter exact size
  
- **Storage Duration**: 
  - 2 hours (Fast response)
  - 4 hours (Standard - Most popular)
  - 6 hours (Extended backup)
  - 8+ hours (Full shift coverage)

#### Step 3: Add Renewables? (Optional)
Visual toggle cards:
- ☀️ **Solar Power** (slider: 0-10 MW)
- 💨 **Wind Power** (slider: 0-10 MW)  
- ⚡ **Backup Generator** (slider: 0-5 MW)
- ❌ **No, Just Energy Storage** (default)

*Show space requirements and visual diagrams*

#### Step 4: Location & Your Energy Rates
- **Where is this project?** (Country/State dropdown)
- **What do you pay for electricity?** 
  - I don't know → "We'll estimate it"
  - $0.10 - $0.15 per kWh (typical commercial)
  - Custom amount
  - [Advanced: Load my utility rate →]

**INSTANT PREVIEW PANEL (Right Side):**
```
💰 Estimated Annual Savings: $75,000
⚡ System Size: 2 MW / 8 MWh (4 hours)
📊 Payback: 5.2 years
🌱 CO₂ Offset: 450 tons/year
```
