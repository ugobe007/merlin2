# UI Fixes - December 26, 2025

## Issues to Fix:

1. ✅ Grid connection questions - Make visually distinct from goals (different icons/colors)
2. ✅ Add clear instructions to select grid connection (make clickable circles obvious)
3. ✅ Change "How This Works" panel color to stand out (currently drab)
4. ✅ Update hours per day scale to 24 hours max (currently 16)
5. ✅ Adjust square footage scale to favor 100K+ range (not millions)
6. ✅ Fix food & beverage icon (currently EV charging icon)
7. ✅ Fix elevator icon to be an elevator
8. ✅ Review and diversify icons (too many EV/hotel icons)
9. ✅ Remove duplicate rooftop solar square footage question
10. ✅ Fix Step 4 to show solar/EV options when selected in opportunity discovery
