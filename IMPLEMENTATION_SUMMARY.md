## 8. 📈 Example: Car Wash Use Case in Action

When a user selects "Car Wash":

1. **System loads template**:
   - 35 kW typical load
   - 48 kW peak load
   - 4 wash bays default

2. **User answers custom questions**:
   - "How many wash bays?" → 6 (increases power by 1.5x)
   - "Average cars per day?" → 150
   - "Detailing services?" → Yes (adds 10 kW)

3. **System calculates**:
   - Adjusted load: 35 kW × 1.5 + 10 kW = 62.5 kW
   - Demand charge sensitivity: 1.3x (higher costs)
   - Expected savings: 25%
   - Recommended BESS size: ~100 kWh

4. **Financial results**:
   - Annual savings: $28,000
   - System cost: $120,000
   - Simple payback: 4.3 years
   - 10-year ROI: 133%

5. **User sees Dancing Merlin** 🎉
