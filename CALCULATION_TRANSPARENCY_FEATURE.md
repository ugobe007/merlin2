# üßÆ Calculation Transparency Feature

## Overview
Added comprehensive calculation breakdown functionality to build user trust by showing **every formula, variable, and assumption** used in BESS quotes. This provides complete transparency and allows users to verify and understand how their quote was calculated.

## Problem Statement
Users need to trust the numbers in their quotes. Without understanding how calculations are performed, they may question:
- "How did you arrive at this price?"
- "What assumptions are being made?"
- "Can I verify these numbers?"
- "Where does this data come from?"

## Solution
Three-tiered transparency approach:
1. **Interactive Modal** - Beautiful in-app calculation viewer
2. **Text Export** - Downloadable detailed formula document
3. **Data Sources** - Clear attribution to industry authorities

---

## Implementation

### 1. Core Calculation Engine (`src/utils/calculationFormulas.ts`)

#### Key Function: `generateCalculationBreakdown()`
Creates comprehensive breakdown of all calculations:

```typescript
export interface CalculationBreakdown {
  section: string;           // "BESS Sizing", "Equipment Costs", etc.
  category: string;          // "Battery System", "PCS", etc.
  formula: string;           // Human-readable formula
  variables: Variable[];     // All input values with units
  result: number;            // Calculated output
  resultUnit: string;        // Unit of measurement
  explanation: string;       // What this calculates and why
  assumptions?: string[];    // Key assumptions made
}
```

#### Calculation Sections
1. **BESS Sizing**
   - Energy capacity (MWh = MW √ó hours)
   - Power capacity (kW conversion)

2. **Equipment Costs**
   - Battery system (kWh √ó $/kWh)
   - PCS (kW √ó $/kW)
   - Generator (MW √ó kW √ó $/kW)
   - Solar (MWp √ó $/Wp)
   - Wind (MW √ó $/W)

3. **Balance of System**
   - BOS percentage (10-15% of equipment)
   - Includes: HVAC, fire suppression, wiring, monitoring

4. **EPC & Installation**
   - EPC percentage (12-18% of equipment + BOS)
   - Engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning

5. **Tariffs & Duties**
   - Battery tariffs (21% example)
   - Other equipment tariffs (6% example)
   - Country/region specific

6. **Application-Specific Costs**
   - EV Charging: chargers + transformers
   - Data Centers: UPS + redundancy
   - Manufacturing: critical load protection + shift support

7. **Financial Returns**
   - Peak shaving savings (arbitrage value)
   - Demand charge reduction
   - Simple payback period
   - 10-year ROI percentage

#### Helper Functions
- `formatCalculationForDisplay()` - Pretty print for text export
- `exportCalculationsToText()` - Generate complete text document

### 2. Interactive Modal (`src/components/modals/CalculationModal.tsx`)

Beautiful full-screen modal showing calculation breakdown:

#### Features
- **Organized by Section**: Color-coded headers (blue=sizing, purple=equipment, yellow=financial)
- **Formula Cards**: Each calculation in its own card with:
  - Category title and result prominently displayed
  - Formula in code-style formatting
  - Variables in 2-column grid with values and units
  - Detailed explanation paragraph
  - Assumptions list (yellow-bordered callout)
- **Data Sources Footer**: Attribution to BNEF, Wood Mackenzie, SEIA, AWEA, EIA
- **Responsive**: Scrollable content, sticky header/footer
- **Professional Styling**: Gradient headers, backdrop blur, shadow effects

#### User Experience
```
