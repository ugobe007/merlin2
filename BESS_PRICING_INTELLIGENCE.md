# 📊 BESS Pricing Intelligence System

## Overview

The Merlin BESS Quote Builder now features a **comprehensive pricing intelligence system** that provides real-time market pricing based on multiple authoritative sources, including BNEF, NREL ATB, and industry contract data.

## Key Features

### 1. **Dynamic Market Pricing** 📈

The system automatically calculates accurate BESS pricing based on:

- **System Size**: Economies of scale for larger systems
  - ≥10 MW: 10% discount (bulk purchasing power)
  - ≥5 MW: 7% discount (large scale)
  - ≥2 MW: 4% discount (medium scale)
  - 1 MW: Baseline pricing
  - <1 MW: 15% premium (small scale complexity)

- **Storage Duration**: Better $/kWh for longer duration
  - ≤2 hours: 10% higher $/kWh (fixed PCS costs spread over less energy)
  - 4 hours: Baseline (industry standard)
  - 6 hours: 5% lower $/kWh
  - >6 hours: 10% lower $/kWh

- **Geographic Location**: Regional cost variations
  - United States: Baseline (1.0x)
  - Europe: +8%
  - China: -15%
  - Middle East: +15%
  - Africa: +20%
  - And more...

### 2. **Multi-Source Data Validation** ✅

Pricing is calculated using weighted averages from multiple sources:

| Source | Price/kWh | Weight | Notes |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **BNEF 2024 Survey** | $165 | 30% | Turnkey systems, 40% YoY drop |
| **NREL ATB 2024 (Moderate)** | $155 | 25% | Median projection, trusted baseline |
| **Industry Standard** | $150 | 25% | Large scale (≥2MW) contract pricing |
| **Wood Mackenzie Q4 2025** | $158 | 20% | Market intelligence |

**Result**: Weighted market average that reflects current market conditions
