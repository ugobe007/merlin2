  "what is bess": `**Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)** is a rechargeable battery system that stores electrical energy from the grid or renewable sources (like solar) for later use.

**Key Benefits:**
• **Peak Shaving** - Reduce expensive demand charges by using stored energy during peak hours
• **Backup Power** - Keep critical systems running during outages
• **Solar Integration** - Store excess solar energy for use at night
• **Grid Services** - Participate in utility programs for additional revenue

BESS systems range from small commercial units (100-500 kWh) to utility-scale installations (100+ MWh).`,

  "how is system size calculated": `System sizing is based on several key factors:

**1. Peak Demand (kW)**
Your highest power draw determines the power rating needed.

**2. Energy Requirements (kWh)**
How much energy you need to store based on:
- Backup duration (e.g., 4 hours of critical loads)
- Peak shaving goals
- Solar production patterns

**3. Use Case**
Different industries have different needs:
- **Data Centers**: High reliability, 2-4 hour backup
- **EV Charging**: Match charger capacity, demand management
- **Commercial**: Peak shaving, demand charge reduction

**4. Operating Schedule**
When you use the most energy affects optimal sizing.

Our calculator analyzes all these factors to recommend the right system size for your needs.`,

  "what do npv and irr mean": `**NPV (Net Present Value)** and **IRR (Internal Rate of Return)** are key financial metrics:

**NPV - Net Present Value**
The total value of your investment in today's dollars, accounting for the time value of money.
- **Positive NPV** = Good investment (returns exceed costs)
- **Higher NPV** = Better investment

**IRR - Internal Rate of Return**
The annualized rate of return your investment generates.
- Compare to your required return (e.g., 8%)
- **IRR > Required Return** = Worth investing

**Example:**
A $500,000 BESS project with:
- NPV of $250,000 → You'll gain $250K in present value
- IRR of 15% → 15% annual return on investment

*Professional and Enterprise plans include NPV/IRR calculations.*`,

Battery storage works great with solar PV systems:

• **Store excess solar** - Don't waste energy, save it for later
• **Use solar at night** - Power your facility after sunset
• **Maximize self-consumption** - Reduce grid dependence
• **Peak shaving** - Use stored solar during expensive peak hours

In our calculator, you can specify your existing or planned solar capacity, and we'll optimize the battery size to match.`;

Battery storage costs vary based on:

• **System size** - Larger systems have better $/kWh economics
• **Chemistry** - LFP (safer, longer life) vs NMC (higher density)
• **Configuration** - Indoor/outdoor, AC/DC coupled
• **Region** - Installation costs vary by location

**Typical ranges (2024):**
• Commercial: $400-600/kWh installed
• Industrial: $350-500/kWh installed
• Utility-scale: $250-400/kWh installed

  if (lowerQuestion.includes('backup') || lowerQuestion.includes('outage') || lowerQuestion.includes('blackout')) {
    return `**Backup Power with BESS**

BESS provides reliable backup power when the grid goes down:

**Critical load protection:**
• Servers and IT equipment
• Refrigeration
• Life safety systems
• Security and access control

**Sizing for backup:**
Backup hours = Battery capacity (kWh) ÷ Critical load (kW)

Example: 500 kWh battery ÷ 100 kW load = 5 hours backup

**Key considerations:**
• Identify critical vs non-critical loads
• Consider generator integration for extended outages
• Automatic transfer switches for seamless switchover

Our calculator asks about your backup requirements to size appropriately.`;
