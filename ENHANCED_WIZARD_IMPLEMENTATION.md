## üí∞ Enhanced Cost Calculation Engine

### New Cost Components Added:

#### **1. Tariff Calculations**
```typescript
getTariffRate() {
  'North America': 1.25% average
  'Europe': 4.5% average
  'Asia Pacific': 7.5% average
  'Middle East': 10% average
  'Africa': 15% average
  'South America': 11.5% average
}
```

#### **2. Shipping Cost Calculations**
