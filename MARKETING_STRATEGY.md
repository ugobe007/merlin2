Hi [First Name],

I've been helping businesses evaluate energy storage for [X] years, and I hear the same concerns:

→ With 30% ITC + [state incentives], your net cost is $[XXX,XXX]. Payback in [X] years.

❌ "Technology keeps improving, should I wait?"
→ Every year you wait costs $[annual savings]. Battery prices aren't dropping 20% in 2026.

❌ "My utility might change rates"
→ 73% of utilities are increasing demand charges. Locking in savings now = protection.

❌ "Too complex to implement"
→ Our turnkey EPC partners handle everything. You focus on savings.

Still on the fence? Let's talk specifics for [Company Name].

I noticed [Company Name] operates [facility type] in [Location] - a market with some of the highest demand charges in the country.

Quick question: Have you evaluated battery energy storage to reduce those charges?

Most facilities like yours are paying 30-40% more than necessary. A [XXX] kWh BESS system typically pays for itself in 3-4 years through:

• 50-70% demand charge reduction
• Energy arbitrage (buy low, sell high)
• Backup power during outages

Would a free 3-minute analysis showing your exact savings potential be helpful?

## LinkedIn Post Templates (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Post 1: Demand Charge Calculator
```
Are demand charges eating your profits? 📊

Most businesses don't realize that 30-40% of their electricity bill is demand charges - fees for your PEAK 15-minute usage, even if it only happens once per month.

Example: A 500kW peak = $9,000/month in some markets. That's $108K/year just for a brief spike.

Battery storage can reduce this by 50-70%.

We built a free calculator that shows your exact savings in 3 minutes:

Try it and tell me - were you surprised by the number?

### Post 4: Objection Handling Poll
```
Battery storage question:

What's stopping your business from installing energy storage?

Vote below and comment why 👇

🔘 Upfront cost too high
🔘 ROI unclear
🔘 Don't know where to start
🔘 Waiting for better technology

(I'll share solutions to the top concern next week)

#EnergyStorage #BusinessStrategy
```

### Post 5: Vendor Marketplace Launch
```
We just launched something that will disrupt BESS pricing 🚀

Problem: Getting battery storage quotes used to mean:
- Calling 10+ vendors
- Waiting weeks for responses
- Comparing incompatible proposals
- No price transparency

Our solution: BESS Vendor Marketplace

Now you can:
✅ Get quotes from 20+ vetted vendors
✅ Compare pricing in real-time
✅ See actual project costs
✅ Connect directly with suppliers

For vendors:
✅ Access qualified leads
✅ Showcase your products
✅ Compete on value, not just price

This is like Kayak for energy storage.

### Post 6: IRA Tax Credit Reminder
```
REMINDER: You can still get 30% off energy storage 💰

The Inflation Reduction Act extended the Investment Tax Credit through 2032.

What does this mean?

A $500K BESS system = $150K tax credit
A $1M system = $300K credit
A $2M system = $600K credit

This is a straight reduction in your tax liability.

Combined with energy savings, most systems pay for themselves in 3-4 years.

But: Many businesses don't know they qualify.

Requirements:
✅ Commercial/industrial facility
✅ System > 5 kWh
✅ Installed by Dec 31, 2032

That's it.

### Post 7: Industry Comparison
```
Which industry saves the most with energy storage?

We analyzed 500+ BESS quotes and here's what we found:

🥇 Cold Storage: 55% average cost reduction
🥈 Data Centers: 48% reduction
🥉 Manufacturing: 42% reduction
4️⃣ Healthcare: 38% reduction
5️⃣ Hospitality: 35% reduction

Why cold storage wins:
• Highest demand charges
• 24/7 operation = more arbitrage opportunities
• Critical backup power needs

But every industry benefits.
