# Changes Summary - Application Costs, Currency & UI Fixes

## âœ… **1. Application-Specific Costs Now Showing**

### Issue
Application costs were calculated in `Step5_EnhancedApplications.tsx` but not included in the total project cost.

### Solution
**Updated `SmartWizard.tsx`:**
- Added `calculateApplicationCosts()` function that mirrors the logic from Step5
- Includes application costs in the `calculateCosts()` function
- Added `applicationCosts` to the costs return object
- Application costs now properly flow through to Step7 (Detailed Cost Analysis) and Step8 (Summary)

**Cost Breakdown by Application:**
- **EV Charging:** Chargers ($8k-$50k each) + Transformers ($15k-$30k)
- **Data Centers:** UPS systems ($500/kW) + Redundancy equipment ($100k-$250k)
- **Manufacturing:** Critical load protection ($150k) + Shift support ($50k-$80k)

## âœ… **2. Fixed Budget "Flexible" Button**

### Issue
The "Flexible" budget option wasn't working - clicking it wouldn't select it properly.

### Solution
**Updated `Step2_Budget.tsx`:**
- Changed `value: 0` to `value: -1` for the Flexible option
- Added `isFlexible: true` flag to the Flexible option
- Fixed selection logic: `const isSelected = option.isFlexible ? budget === -1 : Math.abs(budget - option.value) < 100000`
- Removed fallback `|| 500000` that was preventing -1 from being set
- Now properly highlights when selected and stores -1 as the budget value

## âœ… **3. Currency Selector - Default USD with User Selection**

### Issue
Currency was hardcoded as `â‚¬` (Euro) throughout the application, showing British pounds/euros by default instead of US dollars.

### Solution
**Updated `BessQuoteBuilder.tsx`:**

1. **Added Currency State:**
   ```typescript
   const [currency, setCurrency] = useState('USD');
   ```

2. **Created Currency Symbol Helper:**
   ```typescript
   const getCurrencySymbol = () => {
     const symbols: { [key: string]: string } = {
       'USD': '$', 'EUR': 'â‚¬', 'GBP': 'Â£', 'JPY': 'Â¥', 'CNY': 'Â¥',
       'CAD': 'C$', 'AUD': 'A$', 'INR': 'â‚¹', 'BRL': 'R$', 
       'MXN': 'MX$', 'KRW': 'â‚©',
     };
     return symbols[currency] || '$';
   };
   ```

3. **Added Currency Selector in Financial Summary:**
   - Dropdown with 11 currency options (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CNY, CAD, AUD, INR, BRL, MXN, KRW)
   - Positioned next to "Financial Summary" heading
   - Updates all currency displays dynamically

4. **Updated All Currency Displays:**
   - **Financial Summary:** `{getCurrencySymbol()}{value.toLocaleString()}`
     - BESS CapEx
     - Grand CapEx
     - Annual Savings
   - **Assumptions Section:** All labels now use dynamic currency
     - Battery ({getCurrencySymbol()}/kWh)
     - PCS ({getCurrencySymbol()}/kW)
     - Gen ({getCurrencySymbol()}/kW)
     - Solar ({getCurrencySymbol()}/kWp)
     - Wind ({getCurrencySymbol()}/kW)

**Default Behavior:** Now defaults to USD ($) instead of EUR (â‚¬)

## âœ… **4. Front Page Button Consistency**

### Issue
Save Project, Load Project, and Portfolio buttons had slightly inconsistent sizing.

### Solution
**Updated `BessQuoteBuilder.tsx`:**
- Changed all three buttons to use `px-6` (was `px-5`)
- Added `justify-center` to flex layout
- Added `min-w-[180px]` to ensure consistent minimum width
- Maintained large text size (`text-lg`, `text-xl` for icons)
- All buttons now have identical styling and sizing

**Before:**
```tsx
className="... px-5 py-3 ... flex items-center space-x-2 text-lg"
```

**After:**
```tsx
className="... px-6 py-3 ... flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 text-lg min-w-[180px]"
```

## âœ… **5. ROI Display in Financial Summary**

### Already Implemented
The Financial Summary panel on the main page already shows:
- **Simple ROI:** `{roiYears.toFixed(2)} years`
- Displayed prominently in yellow-300 text at 2xl size
- Located below Annual Savings

The Smart Wizard's Step8 (Summary) also shows:
- **ðŸ’° Annual Savings:** Large green display with breakdown
- **ROI Period:** Shows payback years + 10-year ROI percentage
- All calculated using local utility rates from `energyCalculations.ts`
