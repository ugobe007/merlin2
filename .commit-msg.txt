fix: car wash pricing accuracy - scale costs for small C&I systems

- Scale commissioning/certification/annual fixed costs for <1MW systems (15-100%)
- Fix generator sizing: small systems priced per-kW, not as 2MW fixed units
- Car wash water heater default: electric->gas (removes 75kW from load)
- Tunnel dryer scaling: dryers at EXIT only, don't scale with tunnel length
- Step5 duration fallback: use industry defaults (car wash=2h) not hardcoded 4h
- Fix jsdom ESM: downgrade to v25 (v27 @exodus/bytes breaks vitest forks)
- Tests: 2005 passing (was 0 tests, 27 errors from jsdom ESM issue)
